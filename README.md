## Issues with RESTful Routing

- Restful routing => send a request to server encoded as a `url + request-type`
  
  - for example send a `get` request to url `user/18/posts/author/john` where
    - `get all the posts authored as john by the user id 18` - server has to decode the meaning of the request
